# DeepGLM
Version 1.0<br/>

## Introduction
DeepGLM is a flexible model that use Deep Feedforward Neuron Network as the basis function for Generalized Linear Model. DeepGLM is designed to work with Cross-Sectional Dataset such as real estate data, cencus data, etc. <br/>

For more information about DeepGLM, please read the paper: Minh-Ngoc Tran,Nghia Nguyen, David J. Nott and Robert Kohn (2018)  Bayesian Deep Net GLM and GLMM https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10157

## Usage
### MATLAB Version
To use the Toolbox, add the folder called "deepGLM" (with Subfolders) to the MATLAB path.

The toolbox contains the following folders:

- Data: some datasets used in the examples.
- Examples: examples of all the functions included in the toolbox.
- Documents: documentations for the functions in deepGLM toolbox
- deepGLM: all the functions of the toolbox all here. This is the folder you must add to the MATLAB path.

### R Version



### Python Version
Coming soon...
